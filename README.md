Set of my private and university ML course problems. Tasks which I have solved are given below:

1. Chi Squared Test (Chi-square independence test)

    You are given the results of IPSOS exit polls for 2015 parliamentary elections in Poland in table **data**. Decide if we can assume that gender and voting preferences are independent. To this end:
    <br />
    Compute row totals $r_i$, column totals $c_j$, and overall total $N$.
    <br />
    If the variables are independent, we expect to see $f_{ij} = r_i c_j / N$ in $i$-th row $j$-th column.
    <br />
    Compute the test statistic as before, i.e. 
    <br />
    $S = \\sum_{ij} \\frac{\\left(f_{ij}-X_{ij}\\right)^2}{f_{ij}}.$\
    <br />
    Again test vs $\\chi^2$ CDF.
  

2. Discrete Sampling
